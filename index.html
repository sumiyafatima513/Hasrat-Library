    <h2>Maulvi Muhammed Abdul Qadeer Siddiqui (Hasrat) (1870–1962)</h2>
    <p>
      Maulvi Muhammed Abdul Qadeer Siddiqui (Arabic: محمد عبدالقدير صديقى ‎), widely known by his pen name Hasrat, 
      was an Islamic theologian, Qur’anic exegete, poet, and Sufi of Southern India. Born in Hyderabad in 1870, 
      he was a descendant of the first Caliph Abu Bakr (RA).
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to the absence of formal schools at the time, he acquired education through individual teachers and later 
      passed private examinations, earning distinctions such as Maulvi Fazil, Munshi, Munshi Alim, and Munshi Fazil. 
      At just fifteen years of age, he began serving as a Mufti and teacher of Fiqh (Islamic Jurisprudence).
    </p>
    <p>
      He later became the first Dean of the Faculty of Theology at Osmania University, Hyderabad, under the patronage 
      of the Nizam VII, Osman Ali Khan. His tenure was so highly valued that it was extended annually even after retirement age for a decade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Revered as Bahr Ul Uloom (Ocean of Knowledge), Siddiqui was a master of Qur’anic commentary, Islamic law, theology, 
      and philosophy. He was a prolific poet, writing in Arabic, Persian, and Urdu, adopting the pen name Hasrat. 
      Beloved among his disciples as Qadeer Piya, he devoted his life to scholarship, teaching, and spiritual guidance. 
      He preferred the humble title Maulvi Abdul Qadeer Siddiqui, avoiding other titles his family held.
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed away in 1962 and was laid to rest in Siddiq Gulshan, Hyderabad. A grand dome is being constructed over 
      his grave, expected to be among the tallest in the region. His ‘Urs (death anniversary) is commemorated annually 
      on the 16th, 17th, and 18th of Shawwal, drawing devotees and admirers.
    </p>
    <p>
      A detailed biography titled “ABDULLAH – a Servant of Allah” (600 pages) was later compiled by his grandson, 
      Maulvi Muhammad Anwaruddin Siddique.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first spiritual master was his maternal uncle, Syed Khaja Muhammad Siddiq Hussaini, famously known as Mahboob Allah, 
      who nurtured generations of Sufi saints. Siddiqui often said: “My father is Siddiqi (a reference to Abu Bakr as-Siddiq) 
      and my Shaikh is Siddiq. I am a Siddiqi from every angle.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He travelled widely, gaining knowledge from scholars across the Muslim world, and became a source of inspiration for 
      thousands of students and disciples. Among his renowned students were Shaik al-Islam Sayyid Muhammad Badshah Husaini, 
      Dr. Muhammad Hamidullah, Dr. Abdul Hafiz Qatil, Professor Ilyas Burney, and many others.
    </p>
    <p>
      During his lifetime, he appointed 92 Khulafa’ (spiritual successors) in the Qadri-Qadeeri Silsila. Their influence spread 
      across India and beyond, reaching the USA and Canada. His spiritual leadership continues through his descendants, with 
      Hafez Abdul Razakh Siddiqui serving as the present Ja-i Nashin since 2011.
    </p>

    <h2>Mohammed Abu Turab Ali Siddiqui (Hastee)</h2>
    <p>
      Born on 16 November 1998, Mohammed Abu Turab Ali Siddiqui is the great-grandson of Sheikh Abdul Qadeer Siddiqui (Hasrat), 
      and the 34th generation descendant of Caliph Abu Bakr as-Siddiq (RA). Uniquely, after Sheikh Abdul Qadeer Siddiqui himself, 
      he is the only one in the family to carry the name Mohammed, bestowed upon him in honor of his great-grandfather Abu Turab Ali Siddiqui.
    </p>
    <p>
      From childhood, he has been deeply religious, known for his steadfast observance of prayer and commitment to living within 
      the boundaries of Shari’ah. His heart is filled with the love of the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) and the Ahl al-Bayt, and he strives 
      to always walk on the path of truth, sincerity, and humility.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is often remarked that his face bears a resemblance to his great-grandfather’s Shaikh and maternal uncle, the legendary 
      Syed Khaja Muhammad Siddiq Hussaini (Mahboob Allah). Like his forefathers, he is admired for his kindness, honesty, and spiritual devotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a writer and poet under the pen name Hastee, he has composed numerous kalaams, which reflect his love for Allah, 
      His Messenger (ﷺ), and the spiritual tradition of his family. These works will be showcased in a dedicated section of this website, 
      continuing the legacy of literature and devotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      With sincerity and passion, Mohammed Abu Turab Ali Siddiqui has taken the initiative to compile and digitize his great-grandfather’s works, 
      founding the Hasrat Library as a means to preserve this heritage and make it accessible to future generations. His efforts reflect the 
      living continuation of a spiritual lineage rooted in knowledge, devotion, and love.
